\title{Heston model:
dXt = mu_t * dt + sigma_t * dW_t
dSigma_t^2 = kappa * (theta - sigma_t^2) * dt + xi * sigma_t *dB_t
Where Wt and Bt are (often negatively) correlated brownian motions with correlation rho
We will not simulate mu_t here, that is done in R code elsewhere.
kappa is the mean reversion factor.
theta is the long term mean of volatility
xi is the vol of vol parameter.}
